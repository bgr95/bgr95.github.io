		  			<br>This is based on what I felt after taking a 'half dose' of psylocibin.<br><br><br>
						TLDR: It felt as if each of the billions of neurons in my brain had an opinion.<br>
						Maybe normally, we get lots of ideas in our brain as we process stuff we observe, but this is weighted. Some ideas get more weight than others in some sense, and this allows us to make sense of the world. With psylocibin, it feels as if this weightage system gets fucked. <br>I was still trying to make sense of what I was experiencing.<br><br>

						It was as if I can assign to each of the billions of neurons a color (time varying), and these are related to each other, giving rise to cool patterns. As these associated colors evolve in time, the patterns evolve, coordinating with each other.<br><br>
						It felt as if I was in a world of patterns, created by myself. Then, as I try to focus on some particular regions of patterns, it felt as if it got tensed at those regions, and as I kept going, and tried to focus more and more, it felt like a bubble burst, and all the tension was gone. (Imagine a bubble, filled with smoke (the patterns), and the bubble bursts, and the smoke inside is dropped in a larger bubble. Bubble containing smoke (the color patterns), which itself was contained in another bubble, and so on). This kept happening, as I tried to focus, one bubble bursting, into larger bubble...<br> The internal world feels far superior to the outer world.<br><br>

						When I opened my eyes, the world feels much more colorful. The colors are more distinguishable, and noticeable. As if more neurons are involved in percieving the world. I was just appreciating everything around me, feel grateful about the world.<br><br>
						I just wanted to sit, close my eyes and enjoy myself, but everything else was also enjoyable. If I was just enjoying life, why was I also thinking about wtf was happening?<br><br>
						Quite interesting, how a single molecule, similar to some serotonin can do this.<br><br>

		  			<br>I always found algebra very difficult, but categorical algebra seems very natural and intuitive to me. You might call me a weirdo, and there might be some truth to that statement, but I think there might be some reason for this.<br><br>Maybe it's because with algebra, there are way too many definitions, and we have to get used to them, before getting any idea of what they mean. With categorical approach, I spent more time trying to make sense of the abstract nonsense, and then all the other shit can be reduced from very few of these 'core' definitions.<br><br>

						Earth is probably a living organism, in the following sense:<br><br>

						Each living organism consists of a collection of cells, which communicate with each other, and are related, together they form the living being. Such as a human.<br>
						Earth itself is very similar. It consists of “higher cells” which are other living organisms. Living beings on earth are maybe like how microbiome such as other bacteria etc. are to humans. These can help or cause problems to humans, similarly, the living organisms can help or cause problems to earth.<br><br>

						Earth itself has internal processes, etc. Like the core, it has its own temperature, which it tries to maintain, it contains its own “higher microbiome” consisting of humans and other living organisms. Which can impact the “health” of the earth. Now with humans polluting and shit, we are giving earth some “higher fewer”, and maybe it will do some strong immune reaction to fight off the "infection", and kill the infection causing stuff, to get it back in control.<br><br>
						Let me generalize this further!<br><br>
						Maybe we can think of gods this way, gods as living beings, that don’t procreate to form similar organisms, but can create other “sublife” forms, <br><br>
						Like universe itself can be thought of as a living organism, but nothing above it, that produces it, so it’s like the supremest god, then you have other sub gods such as galaxies > Stars > Planets >... <br><br>
						So, we have some heirarchy based on this<br><br>
						For the universe itself, it doesn’t matter what happens to individual galaxies, and for galaxies it doesn’t matter what happens to individual stars, and so on. Similar to how it doesn’t matter to us what happens to individual bacteria inside us. <br><br>
						So, similar to how we have consciousness, maybe the earth, stars, galaxies, universe itself will have their own form of consciousness
						This would be similar to like how it probably doesn’t make for bacteria what consciousness in humans means, we might not be able to make sense of the “consciousness” of stars and galaxies.<br><br><br>
						Higher organisms, and higher consciousnesses

						<p class="content" align="justify">
							<br>Balaji Srinivasan is epic.<br><br>
							<br>His framework of thinking about stuff is just better than mine. He hits the correct level of abstraction for thinking about political and social stuff, that allows him to formulate and study stuff in real world from an abstract point of view. <br><br>
							He is also very articulate, a trait which I lack.<br><br>
							I feel people always have some framework for formulating problems. Some people use more simplified framework that allows them to formulate more things in terms of a small number of parameters, and some use far complex frameworks to formulate problems, which use too many parameters.<br><br>
							The former are more first principle type, the latter are more social sciences type. The first principle approach are more likely to be correct explanation of stuff.
							<br><br>
							The former is applicable to more phenomena, although it might not be obvious how it's applicable. This is similar to how biological phenomenon are due to physical processes, and should be in principle explanable from physical laws, but it's not clear how. So, I feel there needs to be an 'appropriately general' framework.
							<br><br> Note that this might not depend on the scientific knowledge one has. Maybe it is more related to how pattern seeking the person is? More of a personality trait than IQ.<br><br>
							I believe I am too much to the first principles side, making it difficult to reach the topics at hand. It's similar to how explaining biological phenomena with laws of physics as the  starting point is impractical.<br><br>
							Balaji's starting point I feel is optimal in this sense, for the stuff he talks about.<br><br>

						<l style="font-weight: 400;font-size:  110%;color: black;"><a style="color: black;">Domestication</a></l></label>
						<p class="content" align="justify">
							<br>Arguably much of the evolutionary success of humans can be attributed to our ability to domesticate. Domestication helped us overcome the constraint of food, security and much more. But it is not all good when it comes to domestication. In this essay I want to look at some of the possible downsides of domestication. <br><br>
							Mechanistically, domestication is due to the ability of humans to manipulate levels of neurotransmitters in different species, that allow us to make them do things they wouldn't otherwise. In this essay we will not discuss this side of the issue.<br><br>
							<l style="font-weight: 400;font-size:  100%;color: ;">Pros of Domestication</l><br><br>
							Before dissing on domestication, we have to discuss some of the advantages it gives us. Although domestication can be discussed in very generality, we will look at it via an example, Dogs.<br><br>
							Domestication of dogs has had a very deep impact on humans. Domestication has allowed dogs to be trained to perform various tasks and functions, such as assisting people with disabilities, guarding homes and livestock, and providing companionship. This has made them valuable and useful members of human society.<br><br>
							Domestication has allowed us to outsource some of the tasks required for survival.<br><br>
							Domestication has also been advantageous for the dogs.<br>
							Domestic dogs are able to live in close proximity to humans, which provides them with a safe and stable environment. This can also give them access to regular meals and medical care, which can improve their overall health and lifespan. <br><br>
							This has made dogs incredibly successful evolutionarily. A simple proof is that there are far more dogs in the world than there were ever wolves.<br><br>
							The take away is that domestication allows us to direct evolution of species that increases our own evolutionary success.<br><br>
							<l style="font-weight: 400;font-size:  100%;color: ;">Cons of Domestication</l><br><br>
							While domestication has its advantages, the same advantages can act as a disadvantage in many ways. The human directed evolution poses different constraints of evolution compared to that posed by nature.<br><br>
							The safety and stability domestication offers the domesticated species shields it from evolutionary constraints. This allows mutations that would have been otherwise selected out by evolution to stay in the populations. As a result the domesticated species are far more likely to have genetic anamolies. As a result a domesticated animal will be far less likely to survive on its own in a chaotic nature.<br><br>
							Another disadvantage is that the survival of a dog is entirely dependent on its masters desires which the dog cannot control. While the dog has outsourced its safety and stability to humans, it has lost some of its own free will to humans. <br><br>
							Maybe this can be thought of as trading free will for safety and stability. The dog don't get to make decisions on their own free will or have consequences of their decisions.<br><br>
							We are now coowners of the souls of domesticated animals. So, in this sense I feel, <span style="color: black; font-weight: 400;">domestication is a voluntary or involuntary loss of free will.</span><br><br>
							Evolutionary success over individuality? Is it a good trade?

							<br>This subject has been bothering me for more than a year now, and I thought I should write it down. This is not a new idea, many people have talked about it in the past, including Nietzsche. In this essay, I want speculate what can be the consequences of human domestication.<br><br>
							Instead of discussing whether we are domesticated or not, I will get straight into who domesticated us, and what are its effects. For discussion on the phenomenon of human domestication see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7d1FANcE61c" target="_blank">this</a>.

						<p class="content" align="justify">
							<br>Academia is very slow moving, grants, applications, recommendation letters, heirarchy,... Academia in its current state is highly bureaucratic and I feel this is a huge problem. Although this might be good for 'incremental progress', I feel it is not very inclusive to different types of personalities.<br><br>Most scientists in their lifetime have a handfew of good ideas. So, why waste time? The goal of academia should be to maximize the output of research. I feel there needs to be institutions that can accomodate different personality types than just bureacrats. The academia needs more berserker who enter the field, attempt to solve some big problem, and then leave, instead of trying to develop a career, etc.
